                This river is one of a network of thousands at the front line of climate change.
            </h2>

            <p>
                ON THE GREENLAND ICE SHEET — The midnight sun still gleamed at 1 a.m. across the brilliant expanse of
                the
                Greenland ice sheet. Brandon Overstreet, a doctoral candidate in hydrology at the University of Wyoming,
                picked
                his way across the frozen landscape, clipped his climbing harness to an anchor in the ice and crept
                toward
                the
                edge of a river that rushed downstream toward an enormous sinkhole.
            </p>

            <p>
                If he fell in, “the death rate is 100 percent,” said Mr. Overstreet’s friend and fellow researcher,
                Lincoln
                Pitcher.
            </p>

            <p>
                But Mr. Overstreet’s task, to collect critical data from the river, is essential to understanding one of
                the
                most consequential impacts of global warming. The scientific data he and a team of six other researchers
                collect
                here could yield groundbreaking information on the rate at which the melting of Greenland ice sheet, one
                of
                the
                biggest and fastest-melting chunks of ice on Earth, will drive up sea levels in the coming decades. The
                full
                melting of Greenland’s ice sheet could increase sea levels by about 20 feet.
            </p>

            <p>“We scientists love to sit at our computers and use climate models to make those predictions,” said
                Laurence
                C.
                Smith, head of the geography department at the University of California, Los Angeles, and the leader of
                the
                team
                that worked in Greenland this summer. “But to really know what’s happening, that kind of understanding
                can
                only
                come about through empirical measurements in the field.”
            </p>

            <p>For years, scientists have studied the impact of the planet’s warming on the Greenland and Antarctic ice
                sheets.
                But while researchers have satellite images to track the icebergs that break off, and have created
                models to
                simulate the thawing, they have little on-the-ground information and so have trouble predicting
                precisely
                how
                fast sea levels will rise.
            </p>

            <p>Scientists know that the melting of Greenland is accelerating. As the temperature rises, large lakes form
                on
                the
                surface of the ice, which in turn create a network of rivers.

                “The rivers melt down faster than the surrounding ice, like a knife through butter,” Dr. Smith said.

                The rivers then flow down into giant holes in the ice, called moulins, which drain through tunnels in
                the
                ice
                sheet and out into the ocean.

                “The ice sheet is porous, like Swiss cheese,” Dr. Smith said. “We didn’t know that until this year.”
            </p>

            <p>This summer in Greenland, the scientists set up their camp on the ice, where they hoped to capture the
                first
                comprehensive measurements of the rate of melting.

                Their research could yield valuable information to help scientists figure out how rapidly sea levels
                will
                rise
                in the 21st century, and thus how people in coastal areas from New York to Bangladesh could plan for the
                change.

                Each year, the federal government spends about $1 billion to support Arctic and Antarctic research by
                thousands
                of scientists like Dr. Smith and his team. The agency officials who receive that money from Congress,
                including
                the directors of the National Science Foundation, NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
                Administration,
                say the research is essential for understanding the changes that will affect the world’s population and
                economies for more than a century.
            </p>

            <p>But the research is under increasing fire by some Republican leaders in Congress, who deny or question
                the
                scientific consensus that human activities contribute to climate change.


                Leading the Republican charge on Capitol Hill is Representative Lamar Smith of Texas, the chairman of
                the
                House
                science committee, who has sought to cut $300 million from NASA’s budget for earth science and has
                started
                an
                inquiry into some 50 National Science Foundation grants. On Oct. 13, the committee subpoenaed scientists
                at
                the
                National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, seeking more than six years of internal deliberations,
                including “all documents and communications” related to the agency’s measurement of climate change.
            </p>

            <p>
                Any cuts could directly affect the work of Dr. Smith and his team, who are supported by a three-year,
                $778,000
                grant from NASA, which must cover everything, including researchers’ salaries, flights, food, computers,
                scientific instruments and camping, safety and extreme cold-weather gear. Every scientist, Dr. Smith
                said,
                is
                keenly aware that the research costs “a tremendous amount of taxpayer money.”

            <h3>Getting Ready</h3>

            <p>In July, Dr. Smith’s team arrived in Kangerlussuaq, Greenland, a dusty outpost of 512 people on the
                island’s
                southwest coast, which serves as a base for researchers to prepare for fieldwork on the ice sheet.

                The scientists were excited but anxious as they prepared to travel inland by helicopter to do the
                fieldwork
                at
                the heart of their research: For 72 hours, every hour on the hour, they would stand watch by a
                supraglacial
                watershed, taking measurements — velocity, volume, temperature and depth — from the icy bank of the
                rushing
                river.
            </p>

            <p>“No one has ever collected a data set like this,” Asa Rennermalm, a professor of geography at the Rutgers
                University Climate Institute who was running the project with Dr. Smith, told the team over a lunch of
                musk
                ox
                burgers at the Kangerlussuaq airport cafeteria.
            </p>

            <p>Taking each measurement was so difficult and dangerous that it would require two scientists at a time,
                she
                said.
                They would have to plan a sleep schedule to ensure that a group was always awake to do the job. Everyone
                knew
                the team would be working just upriver from the moulin — the sinkhole that would sweep anyone who fell
                into
                it
                deep into the ice sheet.

            </p>

            <p>The morning before their departure, the team gathered in a hangar to pack gear and provisions: tents,
                collapsible metal cots, generators, pickaxes, crampons, freeze-dried meals, a wealth of scientific
                instruments,
                vials for snow, ice and water samples, and a cooler to bring those samples back to labs in the United
                States.
            </p>

            <p>They also took toilet paper and several plastic bottles, each labeled in marker with a large letter “P.”
                The
                bottles were for the scientists to urinate in should they not want to go outside in below-freezing
                nighttime
                temperatures to the open-air “toilet” on the ice. Afterward they would serve a practical purpose, as hot
                water
                bottles tucked into sleeping bags.

                Not least, they packed a pair of 10-pound aerial drones, to map the icy watersheds.

            </p>

            <p>Every item was weighed and reweighed since the helicopter could carry no more than 360 kilograms — 794
                pounds
                —
                and would have to make several trips. Dr. Smith’s NASA grant covered 10 hours of helicopter flight time,
                including the pilot’s fee, at a cost of about $5,000 per hour.

                The scale brought bad news: The gear was far too heavy. “Now we start getting rid of things,” Dr. Smith
                said
                grimly as he and the team began jettisoning extra food, utensils and blankets. They scaled down to the
                barest
                essentials and anxiously reweighed the items: 359.9 kilograms.
            </p>

            <p>At last the helicopter took off with the team’s gear hanging from an attached net sling. The scientists
                gazed
                at
                the seemingly endless surface of the ice, beneath the chopper, spreading in all directions, threaded
                with
                aquamarine rivers and lakes. After a 40-minute flight, the pilot cautiously bounced the helicopter on
                the
                ice,
                making sure it was hard enough to land on.

                Stepping out, the scientists were hit by the cold of the Greenland summer — the temperature ranged from
                26
                to 40
                degrees while they were there — a constant wind and the glare of the sun.
            </p>

            <p>As the researchers began to set up camp, Mr. Overstreet, the University of Wyoming doctoral student,
                headed
                toward the river, silent as it sliced through the ice. More than any other member of the team, the
                success
                of
                the mission rested on his shoulders.

                Mr. Overstreet, 31, who grew up kayaking and rafting in Oregon, had designed the complex rope-and-pulley
                system
                — modeled on swift-water boat rescue systems — that would be crucial to gleaning data from the
                treacherous
                waters. Before coming to Greenland, he spent months refining and practicing his rope system on rivers in
                Wyoming.
            </p>

            <h3>On the Ice</h3>

            <p>The team soon got to work. A helicopter pilot flew two of Mr. Overstreet’s colleagues, Mr. Pitcher and
                Matthew
                Cooper, both of the University of California, Los Angeles, across the 60-foot river. On the opposite
                bank
                they
                drilled into the ice, attached an anchor and harnessed themselves to it for safety. They attached a
                nylon
                line
                to the anchor, with the rest of the line coiled in a heavy bag.
            </p>

            <p>Now came the crucial part: The men took turns hurling the bag across the river, but it repeatedly fell
                into
                the
                water. After an anxious half-hour, Mr. Cooper finally got the rope across. Mr. Overstreet caught it and
                began
                setting up the rope-and-pulley system he had been testing for so long.
            </p>

            <h3>The rope-and-pulley system.</h3>

            <p>Farther upstream, Dr. Smith cast what looked like three small, round life preservers into the river. At
                $3,000
                each, they were equipped with waterproof computers, GPS and sonar depth technology, all to beam back
                information
                about the river’s elevation, speed, depth and more. But the drifters were on kamikaze missions. After
                sending
                back the measurements, they would be swept into the moulin.

                “That’s 3,000 taxpayer dollars, going down the hole,” Dr. Smith said.
            </p>

            <p>On the edge of the camp, Johnny Ryan, a doctoral candidate in geography at Aberystwyth University in
                Wales,
                launched an airplane-shaped drone from a slingshot-like device, then guided it over a nearly
                75-square-mile
                area. But then the drone went silent. “It stopped talking to me, and now it’s crashed in the
                wilderness,”
                Mr.
                Ryan said.

            </p>

            <p>Mr. Ryan, who wore a hot-pink knit cap and purple sunglasses that set off his bright red beard, launched
                his
                backup drone. Feeling stressed, he monitored its flight nervously as the hours rolled by, drinking cups
                of
                tea
                to keep warm.

                At the riverbank, Mr. Overstreet and Mr. Pitcher started the data collection by clipping a computer
                device
                that
                looked like a boogie board to the line running across the river. Every hour they sent it back and forth
                to
                measure the water’s depth, velocity and temperature.
            </p>

            <p>But as the day stretched into night, the device’s battery, sapped by the cold, began to die. By now the
                sun
                had
                dropped lower, filling the sky with a spectacular orange glow. The scientists were worried — the death
                of
                the
                battery would mean the death of their mission.

                An idea occurred to Mr. Overstreet. He found a roll of heat-reflecting silver sheeting at the camp and
                wrapped
                it around the boogie board battery. During the next run across the river, it stayed alive.
            </p>

            <p>But the battery continued to wane, so Mr. Pitcher pulled out gel hand warmers from his gloves and tucked
                them
                into the battery’s silver jacket. Success. The battery stayed warm and functional.

                For the rest of their time on the ice, the scientists would have to ration the hand warmers. Saving the
                life
                of
                the battery would save the mission to record the first comprehensive on-the-ground, empirical data on
                the
                flow
                of a river off the ice sheet.

                The scientists will use the data, which they expect to publish in the coming months, to test whether
                climate
                models are accurate.

            <p>The data can then be used to create a new model to estimate the amount of water flowing from thousands of
                similar rivers.

                The data gathered from the river at the top of the sheet will be compared with measurements the
                scientists
                have
                taken at its foot.

                With both sets of data, the scientists can help create the most accurate projections to date of the rate
                of
                sea
                level rise.
            </p>

            <p>They might even learn, Dr. Smith said, that the water is refreezing within the ice sheet and that sea
                levels
                are
                actually rising more slowly than models project.

                For three days and three nights, the scientists continued to measure the river, as up to 430,000 gallons
                of
                water a minute poured off the ice and into the moulin. On the final morning, the team, tired but elated,
                gathered by the river as the boogie board made its final trip. By then, Mr. Ryan’s backup drone had
                safely
                completed its mapping mission. Mr. Overstreet broke open a celebratory bag of dried mangoes — a lavish
                treat
                for
                the ice campers.
            </p>

            <p>“It’s hard to make the choice to come on projects like this, but everything in my life has prepared me to
                come
                out here,” Mr. Overstreet said. “We go from battling the river to working with it, and then we learn so
                much
                from it.”
